[@zulipbot](https://github.com/zulipbot) is a GitHub workflow bot application
for the [Zulip organization](https://zulip.org) and its repositories. Written in
Node.js, the bot manages issues and pull requests in the repository in order to
create a better workflow for Zulip contributors.

**zulipbot**'s purpose is to work around various limitations in GitHubâ€™s binary
permissions and notifications systems to create a better workflow for our
contributors. It allows anyone to perform issue triage (self-assigning and
labeling issues), not just the core contributors trusted with full write access
to the repository (which is the only model GitHub supports). Additionally,
**zulipbot** monitors the activity of issues and pull requests, notifying
contributors about new merge conflicts, continuous integration build results,
inactivity, and more.

## Installation

If you're using the [Zulip project
configuration](https://github.com/zulip/zulipbot/blob/master/src/zulip_project_config.js)
